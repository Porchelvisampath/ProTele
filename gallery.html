		<p>Telecommunications, also known as telecom, is the exchange of
			information over significant distances by electronic means and refers
			to all types of voice, data and video transmission. This is a broad
			term that includes a wide range of information-transmitting
			technologies and communications infrastructures, such as wired
			phones; mobile devices, such as cellphones; microwave communications;
			fiber optics; satellites; radio and television broadcasting; the
			internet; and telegraphs.</p>

		<p>A complete, single telecommunications circuit consists of two
			stations, each equipped with a transmitter and a receiver. The
			transmitter and receiver at any station may be combined into a single
			device called a transceiver. The medium of signal transmission can be
			via electrical wire or cable -- also known as copper -- optical
			fiber, electromagnetic fields or light. The free space transmission
			and reception of data by means of electromagnetic fields is called
			wireless communications.</p>

		<p>Data is transmitted in a telecommunications circuit by means of
			an electrical signal called the carrier or the carrier wave. In order
			for a carrier to convey information, some form of modulation is
			required. The mode of modulation can be categorized broadly as analog
			or digital.</p>

		<p>Recently, service providers have been focusing on growing
			services, such as data and video, as opposed to voice communication
			services.</p>
